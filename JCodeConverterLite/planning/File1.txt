
Conversion Tests from Java to Javascript

Task0: write a wider testcase

Task1:
	- House.java converted to House.js
	
Task2:
	- Expressions.java converted to Expressions.js
	
Task3:
	- Insert more expressions into Expression.js, and check conversion
	
Task4:
	- Look for a failed conversion from SF20:
			- Develop 'safe' conversion mode: whenever a line is not recognized,
				it should be safely converted into an 'Unrecognized Line'.
				Template should be build upon unrecognized Lines.
				
			- Lines should be classified into:
			
					- Completely Recognized
					- Generically Recognized as 'if(something){'
					- Partially recognized, as 'something{' which is a block and
							- All lines having a '{' or '}' must be recognized
							with a pattern supporting BLOCK_END or BLOCK_START.
							This should help building data.  
					- Totally Unrecognized
											
			- Execute more test please.
